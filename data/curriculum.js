Keeping this long-term view in mind, VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL has designed a Pre-Primary programme to foster a love for learning among younger students.','The curriculum for three- to five-year-olds is based on developmental needs in all aspects of growth: social, physical, intellectual, creative and emotional. Young students differ vastly in their learning abilities and the rate at which they are able to absorb new concepts. Our programme is designed to accommodate this diversity and create a cocoon of learning for each student.','The Pre-Primary years combine self-directed play and unstructured activities to make students aware of and interact with their immediate environment. A special emphasis is laid on creating an environment which enables students to absorb new information through active participation, visual stimulation, and listening. These activities enable students to start gaining a broader understanding of the world we live in.','Gaining positive self-esteem and building confidence through simple activities is an important goal in the Pre-Primary years. Using a combination of the six senses, students are provided with new and unusual experiences to help build their cognitive and physical abilities. They learn to express various emotions, understand basic social interactions and engage with the outside world.']
