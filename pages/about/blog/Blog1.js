                                in their everyday lives can be difficult in a culture that promotes
                                mass consumption. But it’s more important than ever today to bring
                                up ecologically conscious kids.

                                <h4>Source of Food</h4>

                                <p>Most of the kids tend to take food for granted.
                                    Therefore, you can explain the source of the
                                    food to them to make them more aware of the
                                    food they eat. You can also explain to them
                                    the importance and rarity of the natural and
                                    original food, the way it is sown, grown, yielded
                                    , and harvested. Doing so will not only make them
                                    conscious of the food they eat but also will make
                                    them sustain and conserve food for the future generation.
                                </p>

                                <h4>The 3 R’S</h4>

                                <p>Teach them one of the most important environmental conscious elements,
                                    which is the practice of the 3 R’s – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Teach
                                    them to reduce waste, reuse the materials they use, and recycle whatever
                                    they can.
                                </p>

                                <p>Supporting, encouraging, and educating them to your kids will not only result
                                    in meaningful and creative crafts but will also enable them to live a more
                                    conscious, mindful, and frugal lifestyle.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Saving</h4>

                                <p>Educate your kids to pay closer attention to their environment and surroundings.
                                    Teach them to avoid wasting food and water, avoid unnecessary usage of water
                                    during brushing and bathing, turning off electrical appliances like the TV, fan, AC,
                                    and lights when not in use.
                                </p>

                                <p>These things may seem small, but such acts practiced on a daily basis will definitely
                                    evoke a sense of responsibility and love towards nature.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Spending Time In Nature</h4>

                                <p>Try to spend more time with your kids in nature. Educate them about the various kinds of soils,
                                    leaves, flowers, plants, seeds, trees, fruits, vegetables, etc., along with their benefits. You can
                                    also teach the biological names of them if your child is very much into these things or belong to a
                                    secondary section.</p>

                                <p>To make things interesting, you can even build a home garden and sow small plants and trees.</p>

                                <p>Teach kids about the many advantages of trees, including the oxygen they produce, the shade they offer,
                                    the fruits and vegetables they produce, the wood they supply, the shelter they provide, and everything
                                    else. You can also teach how birds and little animals find shelter in the trees. Try gardening with them
                                    and explain what they eat, from where it comes, how to grow them, etc.
                                </p>

                                <p>All these actions will not only assist kids in learning about their surroundings but will also increase
                                    their awareness of the state of our environment and foster a love for it. Such simple yet effective
                                    eco-friendly practices will definitely make them feel good about themselves and make them happy as a
                                    result.
                                </p>
