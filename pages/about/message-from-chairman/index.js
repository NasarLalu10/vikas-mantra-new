                            <p className='pt-5'>Starting a school isn’t toughest job in today’s scenario, but
                                the biggest challenge is making it a successful one by providing
                                holistic education and helping students to build strong character,
                                excellent academic standards, develop intellectual curiosity,
                                build aesthetic qualities along with strong social, emotional
                                and survival  skills. According to me an ideal school should
                                aim to help a child to find the right path in life while providing
                                an excellent base for over all development. Beyond academics at
                                VMPS, we give ample opportunities to all our students equally
                                to explore themselves in sports, co-curricular and performing
                                art activities through experts from the respective fields.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At VMPS we  believe in working in consensus with all the stakeholders
                                i.e. parents, students and teachers  by providing a conducive teaching,
                                learning environment and a complete involvement of the parents.
                                We  firmly believe that the role of the teacher is not confined to the
                                subject matter delivered and tested in the answer scripts, rather to
                                work with the students to make it more application oriented for life
                                beyond school walls; hence teachers professional development is also
                                our major focus and area of work.
                            </p>
