                                Life at VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL believes in leveraging technology
                                as a tool to enhance learning, as opposed to using technology for
                                technology’s sake. This balanced approach ensures that students
                                are exposed to and benefit from the digital revolution but not
                                at the expense of thorough conceptual learning through the chalk
