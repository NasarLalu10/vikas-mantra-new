                    The VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL Co-curricular programme is
                    central to our philosophy of providing a platform for
                    all-round development of students. The co-curricular agenda is
                    broad, diverse and meant to engage students in activities
                    beyond academics. The Primary, Middle, and High Schools each
                    organize and participate in a mix of activities and events
                    that are age-appropriate and challenging. Our co-curricular
                    programme allows students to apply what they have learnt in
                    the classroom, explore new interests and develop a new
                    dimension to their personality.

                    Within the co-curricular programme, VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL
                    Co-curricular lays particular emphasis on various Art forms.
                    The Arts are an integral part of our programme, in keeping
                    with our educational philosophy which is devoted to
                    cultivating well-rounded students. When our students work
                    together to organise a musical production or think critically
                    about 3D modelling or put together a mural, they are involved
                    in experiences that help build confidence and creativity that
                    can be applied to any human enterprise.

                        Students at VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL are exposed to both
                        Indian and Western music forms. Indian music allows
                        students to immerse themselves in India’s rich cultural
                        heritage and history. Western music gives students a wider
                        context and sensitises them to appreciating art forms that
                        are foreign and new. Besides Theory of Music lessons and
                        classes for practising vocal and instrumental music, the
                        school Band and the Choir provide platforms where students
                        can perform and showcase their talent.

                        photography provide our students with an opportunity to

                        SCHOOL students experience the thrill and importance of

                        Community service forms the third pillar of the alternate
                        learning platform at VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL. We
                        believe that Community Service plays a key role in
                        developing a sense of social responsibility amongst
                        students and its maximum impact is when this sense is
                        developed at an early age. Community Service activities
                        provide students with an opportunity to learn about their
                        communities, serve those living in their communities and
                        learn from those experiences.

                        Right from Elementary School all the way up to High
                        School, students and teachers participate in
                        community-oriented activities. Throughout the year,
                        students engage in programmes which connect them to local
                        community organizations. One such organization that they
                        work closely with is the VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL
                        Foundation which allows VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL
                        students to participate in social activities organized to
                        benefit students of weaker classes of society. These
                        collectively help build a sense of grassroots reality
                        within our students and help them give back to the society
                        to which they belong.

                      Field trips augment classroom learning at VIKAS MANTRA
                      PUBLIC SCHOOL. They not only provide a break from the
                      routine of chalk and books but also serve to expand
                      student horizons through interaction with the local
                      community. Field trips in the early learning years serve
                      as an opportunity for our younger students to experience a
                      world outside school and incorporate enquiry based
                      learning platforms. These outings also enable students and
                      their teachers to interact in a more informal setting
                      creating opportunities to build on interpersonal skills
                      and student-teacher relationships.
